# Ägir
Janitor-inspired local roleplay frontend inspired

## Features and and other cool things
- Local and (optionally) self-hosted, no sync
- Mobile-first
- Unlimited first messages (like, more than ten, insane, right?)
- First messages are editable from chat (not edible)
- rEmber engine (WIP), customizable recap assistant helping to keep track of surroundings
- No JLLM

## Usage
1. You need an LLM provider to use with Agir. Janitor AI calls them "proxies", in Agir they are "engines". Refer to [their guide](https://help.janitorai.com/en/article/the-absolute-beginners-guide-to-using-a-proxy-with-janitor-part-one-19to7y9/) to acquire one for free on OpenRouter
2. Navigate to `Settings` > `Engines`, add your credentials into the form, and hit "Save engine".
3. Navigate to `Settings` > `Personas` and add a persona -- a character representing you in roleplay.
4. Navigate to `Library` and import or create a scenario.
5. Once ready, pick a scenario from library, hit `play`, select a persona and start the roleplay session
