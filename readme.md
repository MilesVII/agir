#### rEmber (WIP)
A customizable recap assistant that helps to keep track of roleplay state. Basically a "Chat Memory" from Janitor but not half-assed.

## Usage
1. You need an LLM provider to use with Agir. Janitor AI calls them "proxies", in Agir they are "engines". Refer to [their guide](https://help.janitorai.com/en/article/the-absolute-beginners-guide-to-using-a-proxy-with-janitor-part-one-19to7y9/) to acquire one for free on OpenRouter
2. Navigate to `Settings` > `Engines`, add your credentials into the form, and hit "Save engine".
3. Navigate to `Settings` > `Personas` and add a persona -- a character representing you in roleplay.
4. Navigate to `Characters` and import or create a scenario.
5. Once ready, pick a scenario from `Characters` library, hit `play`, select a persona and start the roleplay session

You can use [Fenrir](https://github.com/MilesVII/fenrir) -- a sniffer proxy for Janitor that helps to extract character definition even if it's hidden
